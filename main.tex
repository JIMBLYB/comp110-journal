\section{Introduction}

This is a research journal project about the context and influence of my chosen article \textit{A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems}, by \textit{R. L. Rivest, A. Shamir,} and \textit{L. Adleman} \cite{rivest1978_rsa} as part of my COMP 110 module at Falmouth University.

\section{What the Article Explains}

\textit{A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems} explains one of the possible methods to use the \textit{trap-door functions} outlined by W. Diffie and M. Hellman in their paper, \textit{New Directions in Cryptography}\cite{diffie1976new}. They found a method to create a private messaging system over a public channel which used what they called a \textit{trap-door function}; this worked by relying on the fact that there exist some calculations which can be easily calculated one way, but take an unreasonably long time to calculate backwards.

The method suggested by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman uses the difficulty in finding the prime factors of a product of a large prime
